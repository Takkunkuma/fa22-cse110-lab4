        <ul>
            <li>Answer: values added: 20. Vars keyword has the broadest rule and scope. It has functional scope and allows for reassignment.  
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <li>Answer: final result: 20. Vars keyword has the broadest rule and scope. It has functional scope and allows for reassignment.

    <li>Question 3. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. </li>
        <ul>
        <li>Answer: final result: 20. Vars keyword has the broadest rule and scope. It has functional scope and allows for reassignment.  </li>
        </ul>
    <li> Question 4. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.  </li>  
        <ul>
        <li>Answer: This line will show an error, because
        the definition of "result" is only defined within the 
        if block and will not be accessed anywhere else. </li>
        </ul>
    <li> Question 5. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why. </li>
        <ul>
        <li>Answer: This will produce error for both of the mentioning of result. This is because const declared variable can not be reassigned, so result = num1 + num2 will produce an error.  </li>
        </ul>
    <li> Question 6. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.  </li>  
        <ul>
        <li>Then the same reason as Question4, this variable can not be accessed outside of the if block, thus line 13 will produce error.</li>
        </ul>
</ul>
